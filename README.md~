1. assign1.c solves a traffic routing problem using graphs.
2. assign2a.c evaluates a postfix expression using stacks.
3. assign3.c uses the knapsack algorithm to find a set of numbers in an array whose weights sum up to a particular weight.
   It determines the number of times knapsack is called.
4. assign3a.c determines the maximum and minimum no. of times knapsack is called for a randomly generated set of a particular size.
5. assign4.c solves a network routing problem, which sends out the smallest packets sorted by binary tree sort, at a particular time determined by transmission data rate and Poisson distribution function.
